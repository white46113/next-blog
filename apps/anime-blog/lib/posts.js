            {
                question: 'What is dark fantasy anime?',
                answer: 'Dark fantasy anime features morally gray protagonists, cruel or hopeless worlds, meaningful consequences, power that costs something (often humanity or sanity), and stories that don\'t promise happy endings. It\'s defined by suffering that fundamentally changes characters, not just surface-level gore.'
            },
            {
                question: 'What is the darkest fantasy anime ever made?',
                answer: 'Berserk (1997) and Devilman Crybaby are widely considered the darkest. Berserk features the traumatic Eclipse arc and relentless suffering, while Devilman Crybaby offers nihilistic horror and soul-crushing finale. Made in Abyss is deceptively dark with disturbing body horror despite cute art.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Is Attack on Titan considered dark fantasy?',
                answer: 'Yes. While it starts as survival horror, Attack on Titan evolves into philosophical and political dark fantasy exploring cycles of hatred, freedom vs. safety, and whether genocide can be justified. It features moral ambiguity, character deaths, and refuses easy answers.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Which dark fantasy anime should beginners watch first?',
                answer: 'Start with Attack on Titan or Dororo for gentler introductions. They\'re dark but more accessible. Save Berserk, Devilman Crybaby, and Made in Abyss for when you\'re ready for maximum emotional damage and disturbing content.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Why is Berserk considered the best dark fantasy anime?',
                answer: 'Berserk sets the gold standard with merciless worldbuilding, meaningful violence, iconic protagonist Guts shaped by suffering, devastating Golden Age Arc, and the traumatic Eclipse. Darkness isn\'t aesthetic—it\'s thematic. Violence has purpose and consequences.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Is Made in Abyss really that dark despite cute art?',
                answer: 'Absolutely. Made in Abyss uses deceptive art to hide one of anime\'s darkest narratives. It features methodical body horror, child endangerment, existential terror, and a world that punishes ascent. The suffering is slow, deliberate, and psychologically devastating.'
            },
            {
                question: 'What makes Re:Zero dark fantasy instead of just isekai?',
                answer: 'Re:Zero uses death as a mechanic for psychological horror. Subaru carries trauma no one else remembers, experiences realistic mental breakdowns, and endures hopeless time loops. The horror isn\'t death—it\'s remembering everything and slowly breaking under suffering.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Should I skip Tokyo Ghoul\'s later seasons?',
                answer: 'Season 1 of Tokyo Ghoul is a masterclass in psychological dark fantasy. Later seasons (Root A, :re) are inconsistent and rushed. Season 1 alone is worth watching for Kaneki\'s transformation and identity crisis themes, even if you skip the rest.'
            },
            {
                question: 'Are there any recent dark fantasy anime worth watching?',
                answer: 'Yes! Hell\'s Paradise (Jigokuraku) from 2023 blends brutal violence with Taoist philosophy. It proves modern dark fantasy can feel raw and philosophical. Vinland Saga and Goblin Slayer are also excellent recent entries.'
            },
            {
                question: 'What\'s the difference between dark fantasy and horror anime?',
                answer: 'Dark fantasy focuses on cruel worlds, moral ambiguity, and meaningful consequences within fantasy settings. Horror anime prioritizes scares, atmosphere, and fear. Dark fantasy hurts and lingers; horror shocks. Many dark fantasy anime (Berserk, Devilman) include horror elements.'
